# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
An up and coming playwrite, Louise has reached out for our assistance in analyzing Kickstarter campaigns to help her be more successful to get her play, Fever, up and running.

### Purpose
We are analyzing this Kickstarter data to assist Louise to find how to be most successful in launching her campaign. With such a large amount of data, we have been enlisted to assist her in this endeavor.

# Analysis and Challenges
## Analysis
In analyzing the Kickstarter data it was found that while there are many categories of Kickstarter campaigns, theater and plays, both proved to be successful. This is very advantageous to Louise as she seeks funding for her play, Fever. 

She will need to be careful, however, as the higher the goal for funding, the more challenging success becomes in these campaigns.

## Challenges
For me I found that the most challenging part of this analysis was the COUNTIFS function when ranges of values were involved. It was initially frustrating and a bit difficult as not all Excel tutorials were helpful. Gladly, after a few searches, I found a very helpful page which allowed me to figured out where I was wrong and how to correct it.

I would also say, that at times setting the pivot tables up correctly, especially with dates, was a bit challenging. This was overcome just by some experimenting with the breakouts that would occur in the Rows section.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
While there are successes at all times of the year, a theme does emerge that the summer months seem advantageous to theater campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the data it can be seen that the campaigns that are asking for the least money seem to have the most success in achieving their goals. This is not true across the board, but the likelihood of success greatly increases below $5000.

# Results

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions which can be made regarding Outcome based on Launch date. The first is that the most successful time to launch a campaign is April to August. We can also conclude that later in the year, November and December, do not seem optimal as the number of Successful campaigns drop and failures stay around where they have been.

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can conclude that one should keep their goal below the 5000 dollar mark to have the best chance at success as these campaigns have above 70% success rates.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are a two limitations I can see from this dataset. 

First, it is limited to only whether or not the funding was completed. It begs the question on whether or not the play, or more generally speaking, project was completed. 

Second, there is also, for our launch date and outcomes, a lack of statistical analysis that has been done. This may provide us with new insights that may help our overall view.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could get more granular in some of our charts. One example would be creating a Play Outcomes by Launch Date.
